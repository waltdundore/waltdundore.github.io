            <h2>The Story Behind Ahab</h2>
            
            <div class="story-intro">
                <p class="lead">This project started with a simple observation: schools and non-profits are stuck between expensive cloud services, expensive consultants, or complex DIY tools that require expertise they don't have.</p>
                
                <p class="lead">I thought: what if there was a fourth option? What if infrastructure automation could be simple, transparent, and built specifically for education?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="story-section">
                <h3>The Spark</h3>
                <p>One conversation with <a href="https://github.com/krislamo" target="_blank">Kris Lamoureux</a> sparked this entire journey. His brilliant insight made me realize this was possible. That conversation changed everything.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Thank you, Kris.</strong> This wouldn't exist without you.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="story-section">
                <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                <p>I'm not a traditional developer. I don't write most of the code myself. I'm not a project manager, though I coordinate complex systems. I'm not a consultant, though I solve infrastructure problems.</p>
                
                <p><strong>I'm doing something that doesn't have a job title yet.</strong></p>
                
                <p>I direct AI to build infrastructure automation while maintaining safety-critical standards, teaching everything along the way, and documenting the entire process so others can learn and continue.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="story-section">
                <h3>The Method</h3>
                <p>This project is built using AI assistance (Kiro/Claude). I provide:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Requirements and specifications</strong> - What needs to exist and why</li>
                    <li><strong>Design decisions</strong> - How it should work and what standards to follow</li>
                    <li><strong>Testing and verification</strong> - Ensuring it actually works</li>
                    <li><strong>Documentation and teaching</strong> - Explaining what was built and why</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The AI provides:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Implementation speed</strong> - Writing code faster than I ever could</li>
                    <li><strong>Consistency</strong> - Following patterns and standards rigorously</li>
                    <li><strong>Comprehensive documentation</strong> - Explaining every decision</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>This is a demonstration of what's possible</strong> when humans provide clear direction and AI handles implementation.</p>
